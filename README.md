Get Involved: A page describing Jr/Sr exec position roles and how to apply (maybe). 
Newsletter sign up: currently being worked on atm. 

Possible security measures: 
Clourflair: provides end SSL encryption to protect website from malicious HTTP requests such as DDoS attacks. 
Lets Encrypt: proides a digital certificate so our site becomes httpS. but need to renew bc it expires every 2 months.
